Examples

WriteReadRandoms:

This writes a bunch of random numbers to the ThreadGlobal in one set of
threads while another thread sleeps with a BSF groovy sampler and then
reads the threadglobal into an array and drops a debug sampler so you
can see the results.

ReadWriteRandomSynchronized:

This uses my JmeterThreadSynch package to do the same as the above
but without the groovy sleep. Instead, the thread that prints the results
has a checkpoint sampler at the very start of the thread. This will cause
it to sleep until all checkpoints are completed. The threads that write the
random numbers have a checkpoint at the end, so they decrement the checkpoint
each time one completes. The initial checkpoint value is 11 (Because
there are 10 writer threads and 1 reader thread,) when it reaches 0 all the 
writer threads are done and the reader thread wakes up and does its thing.
